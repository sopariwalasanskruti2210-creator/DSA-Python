'''
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. You must do it in place.

# Make Zeos in matrix - Better Approach

# Store the row and column index where 0 is present.
# Instead of immediately changing elements to 0, we first
# mark which rows and columns need to become 0.
# Here we make another row and col to mark
nums = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

m=len(nums)
n=len(nums[0])

rows = [0]*m
cols = [0]*n

for i in range(m):
	for j in range(n):

		# Mark row and col as 1
		if nums[i][j]==0:
			rows[i]=1
			cols[j]=1

# Now if the current element belongs to a marked row
# or marked column, change it to 0.
for i in range(m):
	for j in range(n):
		if rows[i] or cols[j]:
			nums[i][j]=0
