'''
Given an array nums consisting of only 0, 1, or 2. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
The sorting must be done in-place, without making a copy of the original array.

nums = [1,2,2,1,0]
c0=c1=c2=0

# Count the num of 0s ,1s and 2s 
for i in range(len(nums)):
	if nums[i]==0:
		c0+=1
	elif nums[i]==1:
		c1+=1
	else:
		c2+=1

# Append 0 in original array
for i in range(c0):
  	nums[i]=0

# Append 0 in original array
for j in range(c0,c0+c1):
  	nums[j]=1

# Append 0 in original array
for k in range(c0+c1,c0+c1+c2):
  	nums[k]=2

# Suppose nums = [0,1,1,0,2]  ans = [0,0,1,1,2]
# So the 0 is at two index 0 and 1 
# 1 is at two index 2 and 3 
# 2 is at one index 4
# So the index of 2 depends on occurrence of 1
# Same as index of 1 depends on occurrence of 0
