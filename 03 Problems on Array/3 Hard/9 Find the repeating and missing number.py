'''
Given an integer array nums of size n containing values from [1, n] and each value 
appears exactly once in the array, except for A, which appears twice and B which is missing.
Return the values A and B, as an array of size 2, where A appears in the 0-th index and B in the 1st index.
Note: You are not allowed to modify the original array.
